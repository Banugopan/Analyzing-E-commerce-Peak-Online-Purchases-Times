# 📊 Analysis of Online Purchase Times

## Project Objective
This project analyzes online purchase times to identify peak shopping periods and optimize business strategies.

## 🔍 Data Used
The dataset comes from **Kaggle Ecommerce Data from Carrie** and includes:
- **dim_order**: Information about orders (order ID, date, time).
- **dim_product**: Product details (product ID, description).
- **dim_customer**: Customer information (customer ID, country).
- **fact_sales**: Sales details (quantity, unit price, etc.).

The data is stored in **Oracle 19c** and follows a **star schema model** for efficient organization and analysis.

## 📜 Context
E-commerce datasets are often proprietary and difficult to access publicly. However, this dataset, originally from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, contains real transaction data from 2010 and 2011. It is also known as **"Online Retail"** and is widely used for data analysis and machine learning applications.

## 🔧 Analysis Steps
1. **Data Extraction**: Import raw data from the database.
2. **Cleaning and Preparation**: Process data for analysis.
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Identify peak hours for online purchases.
4. **Visualization**: Create charts to represent purchase times.

## 📈 Results
The analysis indicates that most purchases occur between **[XX:XX]** and **[YY:YY]**. These insights can help improve marketing strategies and inventory management.
